## Description
Curious about SQL but not ready to dive into full-blown databases or external connections? This hands-on, beginner-friendly workshop is the perfect starting point. Using the lightweight and intuitive {sqldf} package in R, you’ll learn how to write SQL queries directly on your existing R data frames—no database setup required.

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a powerful tool for querying and transforming structured data, and it’s widely used in clinical research, data science, and industry analytics. In this 3-hour introductory session, we’ll bridge the gap between R and SQL in the most approachable way possible—by working with the data frames you already use in R.

We’ll cover:
What SQL is and why it’s useful alongside R
The basics of SQL syntax: SELECT, FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, and JOIN
How to use the {sqldf} package to run SQL queries on R data frames
Comparing SQL and dplyr for common data tasks
Writing readable, reusable SQL queries inside R scripts
This session is geared toward R users with little to no SQL experience. You’ll learn through guided examples and live coding, with time to practice writing your own queries. There’s no need for databases or complicated setup—just bring your laptop with R and {sqldf} installed, and we’ll take it from there.

By the end of the workshop, you’ll be able to:

Write SQL queries to filter, sort, group, and join data frames
Use {sqldf} to integrate SQL smoothly into your R scripts
Decide when SQL might be more effective than tidyverse functions (and vice versa)
Gain confidence in querying data more efficiently—even with large or complex datasets
This workshop is especially helpful for analysts, students, and researchers who want to become more versatile in handling data but prefer to stay within the comfort of the R environment. It’s also a great stepping stone for those who may later work with external databases (e.g., REDCap, EDC systems, or clinical trial platforms).

Come explore the power of SQL in a simple, approachable way—and learn to make your data talk.
